## Background

Level 1 used a bounded grid — cells at the edge simply had fewer neighbors, since anything outside the grid was treated as dead. Level 2 removes that limitation and adds the ability to automatically classify how a pattern behaves over time, instead of watching it manually.

---

## Your Task

Build on your Level 1 code and implement the following features:

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Toroidal Wrap-Around Mode** | Cells at the edge connect seamlessly to the opposite edge (donut topology). |
| 2 | **Automated Pattern Classifier** | Detect if a pattern is a **Still Life**, **Oscillator (with period $P$)**, **Extinct**, or **Active**. |
| 3 | **Center of Mass & Bounding Box** | Compute the bounding box dimensions ($H \times W$) and center of mass $(r_{avg}, c_{avg})$ of live cells. |

---

## Rules

- Any programming language (Python, C++, Java, Rust, JavaScript, etc.)
- Single program file, runs in your terminal
- No GUI frameworks or third-party game libraries — clean modular code

---

## Concepts You'll Use

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Modular Functions | Structuring logic into distinct callable components |
| Toroidal Coordinates | Wrap-around indexing using modulo arithmetic: `(r + dr + R) % R` |
| State Hashing / History | Storing past grid snapshots to identify repeated cyclic states |
| Center of Mass | Calculating average coordinates: $\bar{r} = \frac{\sum r_i}{N}, \bar{c} = \frac{\sum c_i}{N}$ |

## Feature Specifications & Test Cases

### Feature 1: Toroidal Wrap-Around Mode

In Level 1, a grid has edges — a cell in the top row has no neighbors above it, since those spots fall outside the grid and count as dead. **Toroidal mode removes those edges** by connecting each side of the grid to the opposite side, like Pac-Man walking off one side of the screen and reappearing on the other.

- Off the **top** → reappear at the **bottom**
- Off the **bottom** → reappear at the **top**
- Off the **left** → reappear at the **right**
- Off the **right** → reappear at the **left**

If you physically bent a flat grid so the top edge met the bottom, then bent the resulting tube so its two ends met too, you'd get the shape of a donut — a **torus**. That's where "toroidal" comes from. A cell in the corner now has a full 8 neighbors instead of 3, since the "missing" ones are found by wrapping around.

Formally: row $-1$ maps to row $R-1$, and row $R$ maps to row $0$. Column $-1$ maps to column $C-1$, and column $C$ maps to column $0$. This is implemented with modulo arithmetic — no special-casing corners or edges needed:

```
neighbor_row = (r + dr + R) % R
neighbor_col = (c + dc + C) % C
```

### Feature 2: Automated Pattern Classifier

Simulate the grid step-by-step and identify its state:

- **`Extinct`**: All cells have died (population = 0 at step $S$).
- **`Still Life`**: The grid configuration at step $S$ is identical to step $S-1$ (Period 1).
- **`Oscillator (Period P)`**: The grid configuration at step $S$ is identical to a previous step $S - P$ where $P \ge 2$.
- **`Active`**: The grid has not repeated or died out within the step limit.

**Step limit:** The base `classify` command always uses a fixed limit of **K = 10** steps. You don't read this from input — just use 10 directly in your code.

**Input format:**
```
classify
R C
<row 1>
...
<row R>
```

#### Bonus: Custom Step Limit

Add a second command, `classifyk`, which reads an explicit `K` value from input right after `R C`, and uses that instead of the fixed default of 10.

**Input format:**
```
classifyk
R C
K
<row 1>
...
<row R>
```

<details>
<summary><strong>🧪 Bonus Test Case: Blinker with K = 1</strong></summary>
<br>

*With only 1 step to check, the Blinker's period-2 oscillation hasn't repeated yet — so it's correctly classified as Active, even though it's an oscillator if given more steps.*

**Input:**
```
classifyk
5 5
1
.....
.###.
.....
.....
.....
```

**Output:**
```
Classification: Active
Reason: No repeat or extinction detected within K = 1 steps
Final Population: 3
```

### Feature 3: Center of Mass & Bounding Box

For a given grid with $N$ live cells located at coordinates $(r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), \dots, (r_N, c_N)$:
- **Bounding Box:** $H = (r_{max} - r_{min} + 1)$, $W = (c_{max} - c_{min} + 1)$
- **Center of Mass:** $(\bar{r}, \bar{c}) = \left(\frac{\sum r_i}{N}, \frac{\sum c_i}{N}\right)$ rounded to 2 decimal places.
- If $N = 0$, print `Live Cells: 0`, `Bounding Box: 0 x 0`, and `Center of Mass: N/A` (see Test Case 2 below).
